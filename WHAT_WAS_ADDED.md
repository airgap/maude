## System 2: Real-Time Streaming Tracker 🎯

### The Problem You Identified

"Claude's replies only show up in the UI when they are completely finished, so replies with 20 tool calls don't show up at all until they're all done"

### The Solution

**Tool Call Tracker** - Shows live progress as tools execute, even with 20+ tools.

### Quick Look

**What users now see:**

```
TOOL EXECUTION                              5/20
██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 25%

✓ write_file                              0.3s
✓ analyze_code                            0.8s
⟳ run_tests
○ generate_report
... and more
```

**Instead of:**

```
[Blank message for 30 seconds while tools run...]
[Still waiting...]
[Finally appears when done]
```

### What You Get

✅ **Live Progress Visibility**

- Tracker appears immediately
- Updates as tools execute
- Shows percentage complete
- Displays tool count (X/Y)

✅ **Clear Status Indicators**

- ✓ = Tool completed
- ⟳ = Tool running
- ✕ = Tool error
- ○ = Tool pending

✅ **Smart Display**

- ≤5 tools: Shows detailed list
- > 5 tools: Shows compact summary
- Automatic optimization

✅ **Smart Features**

- Tool execution durations
- Error highlighting in red
- Progress bar animation
- No configuration needed

✅ **Well Documented**

- 4 guides with examples
- Visual reference guide
- Troubleshooting help
- Code documentation

### Files Created

ToolCallTracker.svelte (314 lines)          ← Core component
STREAMING_VISIBILITY_GUIDE.md (312 lines)   ← Complete guide
TOOL_TRACKER_QUICK_GUIDE.md (204 lines)     ← Quick reference
TOOL_TRACKER_VISUAL_GUIDE.md (466 lines)    ← Visual examples
